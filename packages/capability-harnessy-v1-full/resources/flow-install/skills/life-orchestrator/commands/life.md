# Command Contract: life

## Purpose

Produce rhythmic life orchestration outputs — monthly reviews, weekly plans, and daily briefs — grounded in the user's priorities and current project state.

## Ownership

- Owner: julian
- Source of truth: `${AGENTS_SKILLS_ROOT}/life-orchestrator/`

## User Input

$ARGUMENTS

## Context

- Current date: !`date +%Y-%m-%d`
- Current day of week: !`date +%A`
- Week number: !`date +%V`
- Month: !`date +%B`
- Year: !`date +%Y`

## Shared Conventions

### File Paths

```
LIFE_DIR=~/.agents/life
YEAR=$(date +%Y)
MONTH=$(date +%b)   # e.g. Apr
DAY=$(date +%d)
WEEK=$(date +%V)
OUTPUT_DIR=$LIFE_DIR/$YEAR/$MONTH
```

### Priority Reading (ALWAYS First)

Before collecting any project state, read the user's priorities:

```bash
cat ".jarvis/context/private/${FLOW_USER:-${USER}}/priorities.md"
```

This repo-private file is the user's voice. It defines what matters right now, what to deprioritize, and what to ignore. All subsequent state collection and synthesis must be filtered through this lens. `~/.agents/life/priorities.md` is a legacy fallback for older weekly-plan installs, not the primary source.

When `.jarvis/context/private/${FLOW_USER:-${USER}}/competence-priorities.md` exists,
the collector also loads it as the durable learning contract. It may protect a
weekly learning allocation and named outputs, but it never overrides immediate
commitments in `priorities.md`. Daily briefs surface it only when a session,
conversation, review, or output is due or at risk.

When `.jarvis/context/private/${FLOW_USER:-${USER}}/learning-research.md` exists,
the separate `learning-research` schedule rotates through its current topics and
stores provenance-checked sources in the `founder-learning` Jarvis Wiki. The
daily collector removes stale, malformed, and duplicate links. Previously
surfaced, still-recent links remain available only as a resilience reserve.
Daily synthesis includes two or three candidates under `Worth Reading` and uses
the supplied URLs exactly. If fewer than two valid candidates survive the wait
and reserve checks, publication fails instead of inventing a source or publishing
an empty section.

The daily brief waits up to `LIFE_READING_WAIT_SECONDS` (30 minutes by default)
for at least `LIFE_READING_MINIMUM` verified links. Research has its own
configurable `LIFE_RESEARCH_CUTOFF_SECONDS` (90 minutes by default), validated
against the research start, daily-brief start, wait period, and safety margin.
If fresh discovery fails, recent provenance-checked sources form a bounded
reserve. Publication fails rather than silently producing an empty reading
section when even that reserve cannot supply the minimum.

Optional watched RSS/Atom sources live under `reading.sources` in
`~/.agents/life/config.json`. The research job polls them before agent discovery,
stores only content supplied by the feed, uses the article publication date for
freshness, canonicalizes URLs before deduplication, and carries source-tier and
per-brief-cap metadata into the daily candidate set. Secondary sources add
synthesis; they do not replace primary evidence.

When a source enables its evergreen lane, older feed items are ranked using the
human-configured keyword vocabulary and admitted at the configured per-poll cap.
Their original `published_at` is preserved, while `selected_at` determines how
long they remain eligible for the brief. An evergreen URL found in any previously
published daily brief is permanently excluded rather than recycled as fallback.

## Command Router

### `monthly`

Run a comprehensive monthly review using goal-agent.

**Cost:** Expensive (full goal-agent run)

**Steps:**

1. Read `priorities.md`.
2. Collect full project state using the collect-state script:
   ```bash
   python3 "${AGENTS_SKILLS_ROOT}/life-orchestrator/scripts/collect-state"
   ```
3. Read the monthly review template:
   ```bash
   cat "${AGENTS_SKILLS_ROOT}/life-orchestrator/templates/monthly-review.md"
   ```
4. Read all daily notes from the month (the user's own thoughts and action items):
   ```bash
   NOTES_DIR=".jarvis/context/private/${FLOW_USER:-${USER}}/notes/$YEAR/$MONTH"
   for f in $(ls "$NOTES_DIR"/*.md 2>/dev/null); do echo "=== $(basename $f) ==="; cat "$f"; done
   ```
5. Compose a goal file for goal-agent that asks it to produce a monthly review. The goal should:
   - Reference `priorities.md` as the authority on what matters
   - Include the collected state as context
   - Include the daily notes as the user's own voice on what mattered throughout the month
   - Follow the monthly review template structure
   - Write like a sharp teammate who knows the work, not like an AI report or strategy memo
   - Use plain human language, short paragraphs, concrete verbs, and specific names/dates
   - Avoid grand framing and consultant phrases such as "center of gravity", "proof loop",
     "unlock", "operating leverage", "surfaced", "material", "front-line execution",
     "decision gate", "low-friction", "at scale", and "lane-based"
   - Write output to `$OUTPUT_DIR/monthly-review.md`
5. Run goal-agent:
   ```bash
   /goal-agent run "$GOAL_FILE"
   ```
6. After goal-agent completes, verify the review was written:
   ```bash
   test -f "$OUTPUT_DIR/monthly-review.md" && echo "Monthly review written" || echo "FAILED"
   ```
7. Capture trace:
   ```bash
   python3 "${AGENTS_SKILLS_ROOT}/_shared/trace_capture.py" capture \
       --skill "life-orchestrator" --gate "monthly_review" --gate-type "quality" \
       --outcome "approved" --feedback "Monthly review for $(date +%B\ %Y)"
   ```

**Output:** `~/.agents/life/YYYY/Mon/monthly-review.md`

---

### `weekly`

Produce a weekly plan based on the monthly review and current state.

**Cost:** Medium (focused Claude session)

**Steps:**

1. Read `priorities.md`.
2. Read the most recent monthly review:
   ```bash
   cat "$OUTPUT_DIR/monthly-review.md" 2>/dev/null || echo "No monthly review found — running with priorities only"
   ```
3. Collect current project state:
   ```bash
   python3 "${AGENTS_SKILLS_ROOT}/life-orchestrator/scripts/collect-state"
   ```
4. Read the weekly plan template:
   ```bash
   cat "${AGENTS_SKILLS_ROOT}/life-orchestrator/templates/weekly-plan.md"
   ```
5. Read any feedback from the past week:
   ```bash
   find ~/.agents/life/feedback/ -name "*.md" -newer "$OUTPUT_DIR/week-*-plan.md" 2>/dev/null | head -5 | xargs cat 2>/dev/null
   ```
6. Read daily notes from this week (the user's own thoughts, action items, reminders):
   ```bash
   NOTES_DIR=".jarvis/context/private/${FLOW_USER:-${USER}}/notes/$YEAR/$MONTH"
   for f in $(ls "$NOTES_DIR"/*.md 2>/dev/null | tail -7); do echo "=== $(basename $f) ==="; cat "$f"; done
   ```
   These notes are the user's voice — they reveal what's actually on their mind vs. what the system tracks.
7. Synthesize a weekly plan that:
   - Aligns with monthly review priorities (or priorities.md if no review exists)
   - Accounts for current project state and momentum
   - Incorporates any feedback captured since last plan
   - Reflects the user's daily notes — what they've been thinking about, action items they captured
   - Assigns focus areas to specific days where appropriate
   - Identifies the week's "must-win" deliverable
   - Uses plain, human language instead of AI-speak or consultant phrasing
   - Avoids grand framing phrases such as "center of gravity", "proof loop", "unlock",
     "operating leverage", "surfaced", "material", "front-line execution",
     "decision gate", "low-friction", "at scale", and "lane-based"
8. Write the plan:
   - File: `$OUTPUT_DIR/week-$WEEK-plan.md`
   - Follow the weekly plan template structure
9. Run text hygiene cleanup:
   ```bash
   jarvis text-hygiene clean "$OUTPUT_DIR/week-$WEEK-plan.md" --report
   ```
10. Create Jarvis tasks for the week's key deliverables:
   ```bash
   jarvis task create "<task title>" --priority <high|medium|low>
   ```
11. Capture trace:
    ```bash
    python3 "${AGENTS_SKILLS_ROOT}/_shared/trace_capture.py" capture \
        --skill "life-orchestrator" --gate "weekly_plan" --gate-type "quality" \
        --outcome "approved" --feedback "Week $WEEK plan"
    ```

**Output:** `~/.agents/life/YYYY/Mon/week-NN-plan.md`

---

### `daily`

Two-step daily brief: collect state, then synthesize focus.

**Cost:** Cheap (scripted collection + one bounded provider-agnostic AI prompt)

**Steps:**

1. Read `priorities.md`.
2. Run the collect-state script:
   ```bash
   python3 "${AGENTS_SKILLS_ROOT}/life-orchestrator/scripts/collect-state"
   ```
   This script outputs a JSON summary of priorities, project context, recent notes and
   meetings, planning artifacts, git activity, and agent state.
3. If today's brief is already journaled, stop. If the local brief exists without a
   delivery marker, clean it and retry journal delivery instead of regenerating it.
4. Read the current weekly plan and previous daily brief. The collector resolves
   both artifacts and uses an explicit date range in the plan heading when available;
   this prevents a mislabeled ISO-week filename from making a live plan look stale.
   ```bash
   cat "$OUTPUT_DIR/week-$WEEK-plan.md" 2>/dev/null || echo "No weekly plan — synthesizing from priorities"
   ```
5. Run the daily-brief script. Its bounded chief-of-staff prompt restores interpretation,
   routes each meeting commitment once, keeps delegated work separate, and preserves
   carry-forward continuity:
   ```bash
   python3 "${AGENTS_SKILLS_ROOT}/life-orchestrator/scripts/daily-brief"
   ```
   This script internally calls the shared Harnessy AI runner. Set `HARNESSY_AI_PROVIDER=auto|claude|codex|opencode` to choose the runtime; `auto` tries the configured provider order and falls back when possible.
6. Write the brief to `$OUTPUT_DIR/$DAY-daily-brief.md`.
7. Run text hygiene cleanup:
   ```bash
   jarvis text-hygiene clean "$OUTPUT_DIR/$DAY-daily-brief.md" --report
   ```
8. Journal to Anytype:
   ```bash
   jarvis journal write --file "$OUTPUT_DIR/$DAY-daily-brief.md"
   ```
9. Send desktop notification:
   ```bash
   osascript -e 'display notification "Daily brief ready" with title "Life Orchestrator"'
   ```
10. Capture trace:
    ```bash
    python3 "${AGENTS_SKILLS_ROOT}/_shared/trace_capture.py" capture \
        --skill "life-orchestrator" --gate "daily_brief" --gate-type "quality" \
        --outcome "approved" --feedback "Daily brief for $(date +%Y-%m-%d)"
    ```

**Output:** `~/.agents/life/YYYY/Mon/dd-daily-brief.md` + Anytype journal entry + desktop notification

**Safe preview:**

```bash
python3 "${AGENTS_SKILLS_ROOT}/life-orchestrator/scripts/daily-brief" \
  --preview-output ~/.agents/life/previews/$(date +%Y-%m-%d)-daily-brief.md
```

Preview mode does not update crawl state, today's canonical brief, Anytype,
journal markers, or notifications.

After review, publish that exact artifact without another model generation:

```bash
python3 "${AGENTS_SKILLS_ROOT}/life-orchestrator/scripts/daily-brief" \
  --publish-preview ~/.agents/life/previews/$(date +%Y-%m-%d)-daily-brief.md
```

This backs up an existing local brief, promotes the reviewed file, updates the
existing daily Anytype object when one exists (otherwise creates it), records
delivery, and sends the notification.

---

### `status`

Quick view of current life orchestration state.

**Steps:**

1. Read the most recent monthly review (first 20 lines for current priority):
   ```bash
   head -20 "$OUTPUT_DIR/monthly-review.md" 2>/dev/null || echo "No monthly review"
   ```
2. Read the current weekly plan:
   ```bash
   cat "$OUTPUT_DIR/week-$WEEK-plan.md" 2>/dev/null || echo "No weekly plan"
   ```
3. Read today's brief:
   ```bash
   cat "$OUTPUT_DIR/$DAY-daily-brief.md" 2>/dev/null || echo "No daily brief yet"
   ```
4. Check for running agents:
   ```bash
   ps aux | grep -E "claude.*life-orchestrator|goal-agent" | grep -v grep
   ```
5. Display a summary:
   ```
   ## Life Orchestrator Status

   **Monthly priority:** <extracted from monthly review>
   **This week's plan:** <key items from weekly plan>
   **Today's focus:** <extracted from daily brief>
   **Running agents:** <any active processes>
   **Last updated:** <most recent file timestamp>
   ```

**Output:** Status summary displayed to user

---

### `feedback "..."`

Capture a feedback annotation for future planning cycles.

**Steps:**

1. Parse the feedback text from `$ARGUMENTS` (everything after `feedback`).
2. Create the feedback directory if needed:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/.agents/life/feedback
   ```
3. Write the feedback file:
   - File: `~/.agents/life/feedback/$(date +%Y-%m-%d)-feedback.md`
   - Format:
     ```markdown
     ---
     date: YYYY-MM-DD
     time: HH:MM
     type: feedback
     ---

     <feedback text>
     ```
   - If a feedback file for today already exists, append to it rather than overwriting.
4. Capture trace:
   ```bash
   python3 "${AGENTS_SKILLS_ROOT}/_shared/trace_capture.py" capture \
       --skill "life-orchestrator" --gate "feedback_capture" --gate-type "human" \
       --outcome "approved" --feedback "<feedback text>"
   ```
5. Confirm to user: "Feedback captured. Will be incorporated in next weekly plan."

**Output:** `~/.agents/life/feedback/YYYY-MM-DD-feedback.md` + trace

## Safety Rules

1. **Privacy:** Life orchestration data is personal. Never commit `~/.agents/life/` contents to any repository.
2. **Cost awareness:** Monthly is expensive (goal-agent). Don't run monthly more than once per month unless explicitly asked. Weekly should run once per week. Daily is cheap and can run multiple times.
3. **Priorities are sovereign:** Never override or reinterpret `priorities.md`. If project state conflicts with stated priorities, flag the conflict but follow the priorities.
4. **Graceful degradation:** If a monthly review is missing, weekly still works (uses priorities directly). If weekly is missing, daily still works (uses priorities + state). A stale weekly plan is labelled, not silently treated as current.
5. **Jarvis integration:** Always use the Jarvis CLI for task creation and journaling. Do not write directly to Anytype.
6. **Idempotent outputs:** Running the same rhythm twice on the same day should overwrite the previous output, not create duplicates.
