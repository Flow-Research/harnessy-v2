# Jarvis CLI Bridge

You are a bridge to the Jarvis CLI, an AI-powered personal execution assistant for task scheduling and journaling across pluggable backends.

## Plugin Configuration

**Local config file:** `${AGENTS_SKILLS_ROOT}/jarvis/jarvis.local.md`

!`cat "${AGENTS_SKILLS_ROOT}/jarvis/jarvis.local.md" 2>/dev/null || echo "NOT_CONFIGURED"`

If the output shows "NOT_CONFIGURED", you MUST use the question tool to ask the user for the Jarvis root project path before proceeding. Suggest `.` (current repository root) as the default. After they provide the path, create the config file using the Write tool with this format:

```yaml
---
jarvis_root: /path/to/jarvis
---
# Jarvis Plugin Configuration
This file stores local configuration for the Jarvis plugin.
```

## Installation Check

!`which jarvis 2>/dev/null || echo "NOT_INSTALLED"`

If the output shows "NOT_INSTALLED", do not stop. Use repo-local execution from `jarvis_root`:

```bash
uv run python -m jarvis <command>
```

Only show an install warning if both `jarvis` and `uv run python -m jarvis` fail.

## Available Commands

Here is the complete command documentation from Jarvis:

```json
!`jarvis docs --json 2>/dev/null || uv run python -m jarvis docs --json 2>/dev/null || echo '{"error": "Could not fetch jarvis docs"}'`
```

## Maintenance Rule

This skill depends on live `jarvis docs --json` output, but the human-written guidance in this file must still be updated whenever important CLI commands are added, changed, or removed. Keep `src/jarvis/cli.py`, `jarvis-cli/AGENTS.md`, and this file in sync. For a shared skill edit, bump its manifest version and run `node tools/flow-install/index.mjs --skills --yes`; then refresh agent registration with `pnpm skills:register` and reinstall the CLI with `uv tool install --force --refresh-package jarvis-scheduler ./jarvis-cli` when CLI behavior changed. The explicit refresh prevents a same-version local wheel from masking source changes.

## High-Signal Command Families

Use `jarvis docs --json` as the source of truth, but these command families are common enough to keep in mind:

- `jarvis meeting ...`: ingest files, stdin, URLs, Fathom recordings, or Fathom webhook inbox payloads into private context, memory, wiki, or journal destinations.
- `jarvis meeting publish ...`: stage recent Flow notes in a local queue, review one at a time on localhost, update the canonical local Markdown before approval, and publish approved notes to Google Docs plus a configurable Discord text channel.
- `jarvis community briefing ...`: collect a Lagos week of sanitized Flow-relevant evidence, create a private public-safe draft, edit both Google and Discord copy in the shared local inbox, and publish only after exact hash-bound approval.
- `jarvis whatsapp ...`: capture Meta WhatsApp Cloud API webhooks into a local inbox, ingest them into local-first threads/private context/journal/memory, send service-window replies, send approved templates, and review thread status.
- `jarvis reading-list ...` / `jarvis rl`: organize, prioritize, extract, and cache reading-list sources.
- `jarvis content ...`: manage Flow-style content pieces. Use `jarvis content package <piece>` to write `journal.md`, `jarvis content verify <piece> --require <text> --forbid <text>` to enforce canonical wording and configured text hygiene patterns, `jarvis content publish-draft <piece>` to clean/package/verify/sync/dedupe, and `jarvis content audit-anytype <piece>` to check a synced AnyType Collection for duplicate links.
- `jarvis text-hygiene ...`: check or clean configured AI-speak phrase and regex patterns from generated Markdown/text. Use `jarvis text-hygiene check <path>` for gates and `jarvis text-hygiene clean <path> --report` after generating README, PRD, design, technical, review, brief, or content draft artifacts.
- `jarvis sync ...`: sync local folders into an AnyType Collection. Directories become Collections, Markdown/text files become Pages, and other files upload as native AnyType file objects by default. Use `jarvis sync run --source <path> --destination <object_id:space_id> --dry-run` first, then rerun without `--dry-run`; add `--yes` for non-interactive writes, `--prune` when deleted local files should be deleted from AnyType, and repeated `--include-extension` flags to add extra text file types. Handle non-text or non-UTF-8 files with `--unsupported-mode upload|warn|stub|error`; `upload` is the default, while `stub` creates metadata placeholder Pages without uploading the binary content. Use `jarvis sync dedupe --preset <name> --dry-run` then rerun with `--yes` to remove duplicate Collection links while keeping the object IDs recorded in sync state.
- `jarvis object ...` / `jarvis o`: inspect or edit arbitrary backend objects.
- `jarvis journal ...` / `jarvis j`: write, list, read, search, and summarize journal entries.

## User Request

$ARGUMENTS

## Execution Logic

### 1. First-Time Setup Detection

If the plugin is NOT_CONFIGURED:
1. Ask user for Jarvis root project path (suggest default: `.` current repository root)
2. Validate the path exists and contains a `context/` folder
3. Create `${AGENTS_SKILLS_ROOT}/jarvis/jarvis.local.md` with the configuration
4. Ask if they want to initialize context files now

### 2. Context Initialization (when user requests "init" or first-time setup)

When the user explicitly requests to initialize Jarvis context (via `init`, `setup`, or when offered during first-time setup):

**Step A: Ask which locations to sync**

Use the question tool with these options:
- **Global only** (~/.jarvis/context/) - User-wide preferences
- **Current folder only** (./.jarvis/context/) - Project-specific context
- **Both locations** (Recommended) - Set up both global and folder context

**Step B: Copy template files**

Read the template files from `{jarvis_root}/context/` and copy them to the selected location(s).

**Template files to sync:**
- preferences.md
- patterns.md
- constraints.md
- priorities.md
- goals.md
- projects.md
- recurring.md
- focus.md
- blockers.md
- calendar.md
- delegation.md
- decisions.md

**Rules:**
- SKIP files that already exist (preserve user customizations)
- Only add files that are missing
- Report which files were added vs skipped

**Step C: Configure context inheritance (for folder context)**

When initializing folder context, ask the user how they want to handle inheritance from global context:

Use the question tool with these options:
- **Inherit from global** (Recommended) - Folder files include `{{global}}` to inherit global settings, then add project-specific overrides
- **Override global** - Folder files are standalone and completely override global settings
- **Empty files** - Start with blank files for full manual control

If "Inherit from global" is selected, create folder context files with this pattern:

```markdown
{{global}}

## Project-Specific Overrides

<!-- Add project-specific settings below -->
```

This allows users to maintain global defaults while adding per-project customizations.

**Step D: Add to .gitignore (for folder context)**

When initializing folder context (not global), automatically add `.jarvis/` to the project's `.gitignore`:

1. Check if `.gitignore` exists in the current directory
2. If it exists, check if `.jarvis/` is already listed
3. If not listed, append `.jarvis/` to the file
4. If `.gitignore` doesn't exist, create it with `.jarvis/` as the first entry
5. Inform the user that `.jarvis/` was added to `.gitignore`

This ensures personal context files are never accidentally committed to version control.

**Step E: Confirm completion**

Show the user:
- Which files were created
- Which files were skipped (already existed)
- Whether files inherit from global (contain `{{global}}`) or are standalone
- Whether `.jarvis/` was added to `.gitignore`
- Next steps: "Run `jarvis context status` to verify, or `jarvis context edit <file>` to customize"

### Context Inheritance Reference

The `{{global}}` placeholder in folder context files includes the content of the corresponding global file. This allows:

| Pattern | Use Case |
|---------|----------|
| `{{global}}` at top | Inherit all global settings, add project overrides below |
| No `{{global}}` | Completely override global settings for this project |
| `{{global}}` in middle | Mix custom content before and after global settings |

Example folder `goals.md` with inheritance:
```markdown
{{global}}

## Project-Specific Goals

- Complete the API integration by end of sprint
- Reduce test suite runtime to under 5 minutes
```

### 3. Normal Command Execution

For all other commands (analyze, suggest, journal, etc.):

1. **Parse the request** - Determine which Jarvis command to execute
2. **Validate options** - Ensure options match the command documentation
3. **Execute the command** - Run via Bash tool
4. **Report results** - Show output to user

### 4. File Journaling

When a file or document has been created, generated, or discussed in conversation and the user wants to journal about it, **always ask** the user how they want to journal it before executing.

**Trigger:** The user says something like "journal this", "save this to journal", "write this to journal", or references journaling a file/document that was just created or discussed.

**Step A: Ask the user**

Use the question tool with these options:
- **Full content** — Journals the entire file with an AI-generated summary prepended. Uses `jarvis j --file path/to/file.md`
- **Summary only** — You write a concise summary of the file and journal just that text. Uses `jarvis j "your summary here"`

**Step B: Execute based on choice**

If **Full content**:
```bash
jarvis j --file /path/to/file.md --title "Descriptive Title"
```
This reads the file, generates an AI summary paragraph, and saves `summary + --- + full content` to the active backend.

If **Summary only**:
Write a thoughtful, detailed summary yourself (not a one-liner) and pass it inline:
```bash
jarvis j "Your detailed summary of the document..." --title "Descriptive Title"
```

**Important:** Never silently decide which approach to use. Always ask first so the user controls what goes into their journal.

### Android APK Execution

When the user wants to run an Android APK locally:

1. Prefer `jarvis apk /path/to/app.apk` for the quick path
2. Use `jarvis android avds` first if they need to inspect available emulators
3. Use `jarvis android run /path/to/app.apk --avd <name>` when the AVD must be selected explicitly

Examples:

```bash
jarvis apk ~/Downloads/demo.apk
jarvis android avds
jarvis android run ./builds/demo.apk --avd Medium_Phone_API_36.1 --reinstall
```

Meeting project aliases live in
`.jarvis/context/private/<user>/meeting-routes.yaml`. A mapping such as
`project_aliases: {garden: flow}` sends both inferred Garden matches and
explicit `--project garden` ingests to the Flow meeting folder, combines
Garden and Flow route scores, and retains `garden` once in the note tags.

Scheduled Fathom polls must omit `--json`, because full JSON includes transcript
and raw markdown in cron-captured output. Use the normal count/state output and
keep `~/.agents/cron/` directories at `0700` with files at `0600`.

Meeting publication is approval-gated and Flow-only. The SQLite queue stores
paths, hashes, state, and remote IDs, plus reviewer-edited Discord copy during
approval or retry. The local review inbox can validate and atomically update the
actual canonical Markdown while leaving the item pending review. A source update
clears stale approval and Discord override state. Google receives the approved
formatted canonical note; Discord
receives one approved purpose sentence (defaulting to the note's Meeting Purpose
section) and the Google Doc link. `meeting_publication.discord_channel_id` is configurable.
Existing published items retain their stored channel/message coordinates when
an edited source note is reapproved.
The preflight command fails unless the cutover, owner-only local state, review
service, worker schedule, exact Google owner, Discord bot, and configured channel
are ready. Notes without a non-empty Executive Summary or with a transcript
section never become eligible. Cutover archives older unpublished rows without
deleting queue history.

Weekly community briefings use a separate owner-only SQLite queue and stable
Monday artifact key. Sunday generation does not publish and does not overwrite
an existing draft. Collection strips direct identifiers, links, credentials,
participant metadata, and local paths before a classifier sees bounded excerpts;
the writer sees only accepted public fact cards. Reviewers edit `briefing.md` and
the at-most-three-sentence Discord copy together, and approval binds their exact
combined hash. Google Docs use `Flow Research/Weekly Briefings/YYYY`; Discord
uses its dedicated configured channel. The generator and five-minute worker may
use launchd `RunAtLoad` for reboot catch-up, but both schedules remain explicit
machine opt-ins.

### 5. Reading List Reorganization

There are **two paths** for organizing reading lists. Always prefer the agent-orchestrated path when running as a skill. Fall back to the CLI-native path only when the user explicitly asks to run a terminal command.

---

#### Path A: Agent-Orchestrated (Primary)

Use this path whenever the user asks to "organize", "prioritize", "sort", or "reorganize" a reading list. The agent performs the research and scoring itself, using the CLI only for data I/O.

**Step 1: Extract raw items**

```bash
jarvis reading-list extract <target>
```

This returns clean JSON with source metadata and unscored items:

```json
{
  "source": {
    "title": "My Reading List",
    "source_type": "anytype",
    "source_ref": "https://object.any.coop/...",
    "object_id": "bafyrei...",
    "space_id": "...",
    "supports_write_back": true
  },
  "items": [
    {
      "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/...",
      "title": "Paper Title",
      "description": "",
      "section": "AI Research",
      "domain": "arxiv.org",
      "item_type": "paper"
    }
  ],
  "count": 42
}
```

Parse this JSON. Note the `source.supports_write_back` flag and `source.object_id` / `source.space_id` for later.

**Step 2: Load project context**

Read the following files from `.jarvis/context/` (current workspace) to understand what matters right now:

- `focus.md` — current development mode and active project
- `priorities.md` — priority ordering
- `goals.md` — sprint goals and phase milestones
- `plans/` — find the most recent `*roadmap*.md` file for the active roadmap

Synthesize these into your understanding of what the user needs to read *right now* vs. what can wait.

**Step 3: Research and score each item**

For each item (or process in batches of 5-10 for efficiency):

1. **Read the URL** using WebFetch to get the page title and content summary
2. **Score relevance** (1-5) using this rubric:
   - 5 = directly affects current sprint deliverables
   - 4 = strongly informs the next active phase
   - 3 = useful supporting context for active work
   - 2 = peripheral but related to the project domain
   - 1 = broad background only
3. **Score urgency** (1-5) using this rubric:
   - 5 = needed this week to unblock work
   - 4 = needed before the next sprint
   - 3 = useful this month
   - 2 = useful later
   - 1 = no time pressure
4. **Assign a topic** from this taxonomy (use exactly these values):
   - `agent_runtime` — AI agents, Claude, OpenClaw, Jarvis, multi-agent systems
   - `memory_context` — memory systems, context engineering, RAG context
   - `bittensor_economics` — Bittensor, subnets, TAO, alpha tokens, mining economics
   - `task_decomposition` — workflow orchestration, task graphs, decomposition
   - `distributed_systems` — consensus, networking, distributed compute
   - `knowledge_graphs` — knowledge graphs, provenance, graph databases
   - `rag_retrieval` — RAG, retrieval, vector search, embeddings
   - `security_privacy` — security, privacy, secure aggregation, trust
   - `developer_tooling` — GitHub, CLI tools, testing, code review, dev infra
   - `content_automation` — content creation, podcasts, YouTube, social media
   - `hardware_infrastructure` — hardware, GPU, PCB, energy, robotics
   - `market_macro` — markets, economy, Nigeria, stablecoins, macro trends
   - `other` — anything not matching above
5. **Write a one-sentence rationale** explaining why this item matters (or doesn't) for the current work

**Step 4: Map scores to tiers**

| Condition | Tier |
|-----------|------|
| relevance >= 4 AND urgency >= 4 | `read_now` |
| relevance >= 3 AND urgency >= 3 | `this_week` |
| relevance >= 3 | `this_month` |
| relevance == 2 | `reference` |
| relevance <= 1 | `deferred` |

**Step 5: Format prioritized markdown**

Structure the output as:

```markdown
# Reading List Prioritized — {source.title}

Source: {source.source_ref}
Generated: {ISO timestamp}

## Read Now

### {Topic Label}

> {shared rationale if all items in this topic group share the same rationale}

- **{Title}** [Paper] — {Rationale} | [Link](url)
- **{Title}** [Article] | [Link](url)

### {Another Topic}

- **{Title}** [Repo] — {Rationale} | [Link](url)

## This Week

...

## This Month

...

## Reference

...

## Deferred

...
```

Formatting rules:
- Group by tier (Read Now > This Week > This Month > Reference > Deferred)
- Within each tier, group by topic
- Topic headings use title case with underscores replaced by spaces
- If all items in a topic group share the same rationale, show it once as a blockquote and omit per-item rationales
- Type badges in brackets: `[Paper]`, `[Article]`, `[Repo]`, `[Tweet]`, `[Video]`, `[PDF]`
- For URLs with unreadable titles (S3 links, SSRN IDs), extract a readable title from the domain + path
- Link always at the end: `| [Link](url)`
- Skip empty tiers entirely

**Step 6: Present to user and ask for actions**

Show the formatted markdown to the user, then ask:

Use the question tool with these options (allow multiple selections):
- **Write back to source** — Updates the original AnyType/Notion object with the prioritized list
- **Save to journal** — Creates a journal entry with the prioritized list
- **Export to file** — Saves the markdown to a local file
- **Done** — No further action needed

**Step 7: Execute chosen actions**

For **write back**: Save the markdown to a temp file, then:
```bash
jarvis reading-list write-back <target> --file /tmp/reading-list-prioritized.md
```

For **journal**: Save the markdown to a temp file, then:
```bash
jarvis j --file /tmp/reading-list-prioritized.md --title "Reading List Prioritized — {source.title}"
```

For **export**: Write the markdown to the user-specified path using the Write tool.

---

#### Path B: CLI-Native (Terminal Fallback)

Use this only when the user explicitly asks to run a CLI command, or for quick non-interactive use.

1. **Preview items** — `jarvis reading-list list <target>` to see extracted links
2. **Organize with CLI AI** — `jarvis rl <target>` deep-fetches URLs and uses the Anthropic API to score
3. **Output formats** — `--format table` (terminal), `--format markdown` (document), `--format json` (data)
4. **Write back** — `jarvis rl <target> --write-back` updates the source object
5. **Save to journal** — `jarvis rl <target> --journal`

**Filtering:** `--tier read_now` or `--topic agent_runtime` to narrow output.

**Cache:** Results are cached by source fingerprint. Use `--no-cache` to force refresh, or `jarvis reading-list cache-clear` to wipe caches.

### Execution Notes

- **Interactive commands**: Commands like `jarvis apply` are interactive. Warn the user these work best in their terminal.
- **Backend required**: Commands require the active backend to be configured and reachable. AnyType needs desktop app running; Notion needs token + DB config.
- **Space selection**: Commands may prompt for space selection on first use. Use `--space` to override.

## No Arguments Behavior

If no arguments provided AND plugin is configured, show:
1. Jarvis version and description
2. Quick summary of available command categories:
   - **Scheduling**: analyze, suggest, apply, rebalance
   - **Journaling**: journal write/list/read/search/insights (or `j` shortcut)
   - **Reading lists**: reading-list organize/list/cache-clear (or `rl` shortcut)
   - **Context**: context status/edit, init
   - **Utilities**: spaces, object get/edit, docs
 3. Example usage: `/jarvis rl "https://object.any.coop/..."`
4. Offer: "Would you like to initialize Jarvis context in the current folder?"

## Error Handling

| Error | Response |
|-------|----------|
| NOT_CONFIGURED | Ask for Jarvis root path, create config file |
| Command not found | "That command doesn't exist. Available commands: [list]" |
| Connection refused | "Cannot connect to the active backend. For AnyType, start desktop app. For Notion, verify token/config." |
| Invalid option | "Invalid option for this command. Available options: [list from docs]" |
| API key missing | "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY not set. AI features require this environment variable." |
| Template path not found | "Could not find context templates at {jarvis_root}/context/. Please verify your Jarvis root path." |

## Feedback Capture

After completion, ask the user: **"Any feedback on this run? (skip to finish)"**
If provided, capture it:
```bash
python3 "${AGENTS_SKILLS_ROOT}/_shared/trace_capture.py" capture \
    --skill "jarvis" --gate "run_retrospective" --gate-type "retrospective" \
    --outcome "approved" --feedback "<user's feedback>"
```
